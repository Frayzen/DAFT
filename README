[ =====--------------- ]
        25/100

Version: 1.0

SUMARY:

This is the first version of the project, developed in a bit less than 2 weeks,
We implemented a basic working version of the raytracing algorithm using the SDL library only

We load and support OBJ files
The current program is a demo for the moment and the loads of the files are in the .c files only

We optimized the raytracing by using Bounding Boxes structure.

We also use UV mapping in order to create a background
