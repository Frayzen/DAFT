<h1>DAFT: Raytracer Engine</h1>
![alt text](https://frayzen.github.io/DAFT/assets/img/daft_logo_wbg.png)

<p>DAFT is a powerful and flexible raytracer engine developed as part of a project at EPITA engineer school. It allows
    you to generate stunning 3D images by simulating the behavior of light in a virtual scene. Whether you're a computer
    graphics enthusiast, a student, or a professional, DAFT provides a solid foundation for creating realistic
    renderings.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
Raytracing: DAFT uses the raytracing technique to trace the path of light rays, simulating their interactions with
virtual objects and calculating the final color of each pixel in the image.
<ul>
    <li>
        Shading Models: The engine supports various shading models, including Lambertian, Phong, and Blinn-Phong, to
        give objects different material appearances and lighting effects.
    </li>
    <li>Reflection and Refraction: DAFT accurately handles reflection and refraction of light rays, enabling the rendering
    of reflective surfaces, transparent materials, and complex optical effects.
    Shadows: The engine calculates shadows by casting rays from each point towards the light sources, providing
    realistic and accurate shadowing in the rendered images.</li>
    <li>Object Primitives: DAFT supports basic geometric primitives such as spheres, planes, and triangles, allowing you to
    create and arrange objects in your scenes easily.
    Texture Mapping: You can apply textures to objects using UV mapping, providing detailed and realistic surface
    appearances.</li>
    <li>Scene Description: Scenes are described using a simple text-based scene file format, allowing you to define camera
    positions, light sources, objects, and their materials easily.</li>
